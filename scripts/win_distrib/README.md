# Scripts for creating standalone installation for Scratch Portable for Windows.

## Step 1.

  Install nodejs 64-bit version,
  for example from here: https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.13.0/node-v10.13.0-x64.msi

## Step 2.
  Install Nullsoft Install System:
  https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download

## Step 3.

  run build-prod.bat directly from this directory. You must be connected to internet
  and depending on your connection, it may take a long time.
  If some errors occurred or connection gets interrupted, you may have to run
  this again in order to fully install / build repository.

## Step 4.

  You can now copy and use produced installer on any Windows systems from
  distrib\ScratchPortableInstall.exe
  (Installer does not require anything else to run prior installation)
