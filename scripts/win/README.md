# Scripts for running Scratch Portable with nodejs installed globally.

##Step 1.

  Install nodejs 64-bit version,
  for example from here: https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.13.0/node-v10.13.0-x64.msi

##Step 2.

  run build-prod.bat directly from this directory. You must be connected to internet
  and depending on your connection, it may take a long time. 
  If some errors occurred or connection gets interrupted, you may have to run
  this again in order to fully install / build repository.

##Step 3.

  Now you are ready to run Scratch Portable. You can use this step again next
  time you boot your computer to start serving content. No need to repeat steps 1 and 2.
