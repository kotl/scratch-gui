  this again in order to fully install / build repository.

### Run

  Now you are ready to run Scratch Portable. You can use this step again next
  time you boot your computer to start serving content. No need to repeat steps 1 and 2.

  in case you need to stop, it press Ctrl+C

  Alternatively, you can try running serve-ind-cluster.bat that should be more performant version.
